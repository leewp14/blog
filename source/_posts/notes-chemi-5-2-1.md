# Carbon Compounds
## Carbon Compounds
- A carbon compound is a compound comprising carbon elements. 
- A carbon compound can be classified as : 
    - Organic carbon compound
    - Inorganic carbon compound
### a) Organic Carbon Compound
- An organic carbon compound is a carbon compound that contains a chemical bond between the carbon and hydrogen atoms, C-H
- Such compounds come from living organisms such as plants and animals. 
- All living things and fossil fuels contain organic carbon compounds. 
- Some examples of organic carbon compounds are carbohydrates, proteins, cellulose, fats, vitamins, hormones, and enzymes. 
- Petoleum, natural gas, and coal are examples of organic carbon compounds that are used as fossil fuel. 
- Synthetic materials that make use of raw materials such as petroleum and natural gas are also organic carbon compounds. Example : plastic, aynthetic fiber, synthetic rubber, was, and pesticides. 
- The combustion of organic compounds produces carbon dioxide and water. 
### b) Inorganic Carbon Compound
- Inorganic carbon compounds are carbon compounds that do not originated from living organisms. 
- Such compounds are obtained from the Earth's resources. 
- Inorganic carbon compounds usually contain anions such as oxide ions `O^2-`, carbonates ions `CO3^2-`, hydrogen carbonate (bicarbonate) ions `HCO3^-` or cyanide `CN^-`. 
- Examples of inorganic carbon compounds are as follows : 
    - Carbon Monoxide `CO`
    - Carbon Dioxide `CO2`
    - Carbon Disulphate `CS2`
    - Potassium Carbonate `K2CO3`
    - Sodium Cyanide `NaCN`
    - Sodium Hydrogen Carbonate `NaHCO3`
    - Sodium Thiocyanide `NaSCN`
### c) Comparison between organic and inorganic carbon compounds
- Both carbon compounds contains carbon elements
- Originate from living things ?
    - Organic : Yes
    - Inorganic : No
- Combusts in air to produce carbon dioxide and water?
    - Organic: Yes
    - Inorganic: No
- Size of molecules or compounds?
    - Organic: Usually large
    - Inorganic: Small
- Solubility?
    - Organic: Usually dissolve in organic solvent such as alcohol
    - Inorganic: Usually dissolve in inorganic solvents such as water
- Example?
    - Organic: Starch
    - Inorganic: Carbon Dioxide

## Carbon Bonds
- Carbon atom has the electron arrangement 2.4. This means that each carbon atom can be used four of its electrons in the outermost shell to form four covalent bonds. 
- Some of the types of covalent bonds that form between carbon atoms or carbon atoms and other atoms are shown below:
